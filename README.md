This project is a [PHP PECL extension](http://pecl.php.net/package/PHK "PHP PECL extension").

It is an OPTIONAL runtime accelerator for [PHK](http://phk.tekwire.net "PHK") and [Automap](http://automap.tekwire.net "Automap"). It does not bring any new features. It just improves performance.

[PHK](http://phk.tekwire.net "PHK") is a 'jar-like' package system for PHP and [Automap](http://automap.tekwire.net "Automap") is a map-based autoloader. Both PECL extensions were merged for performance reasons.

This extension has no configuration settings. Just compile, install, and activate (in your PHP configuration). Once active, it will be used automatically. More information on PECL module installation in available in [the PHP documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/install.pecl.php).

Please download releases from the [PECL website](https://pecl.php.net/package/PHK).
