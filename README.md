This project is a [PHP PECL extension](http://pecl.php.net/package/PHK "PHP PECL extension").

It is an OPTIONAL runtime accelerator for [PHK](http://phk.tekwire.net "PHK") and [Automap](http://automap.tekwire.net "Automap"). It does not bring any new features. It just improves performance.

PHK is a 'jar-like' package system for PHP and Automap is a map-based autoloader. Bot PECL extensions were merged for performance reasons because they have strong interactions.

This extension has no config settings. Just compile, install, and activate (in your PHP configuration). More information on PECL module installation in available in [the PHP documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/install.pecl.php).
